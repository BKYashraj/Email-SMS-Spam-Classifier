# Email and SMS Spam Classifier

## Project Overview
Developed a Machine Learning model to classify emails and SMS messages as spam or non-spam using Python and various libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, nltk, and NumPy.

## Features
- Utilized `nltk` libraries to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as tokenization, stemming, removing stopwords, and punctuation.
- Enhanced Naive Bayes algorithm to achieve a precision of 1.0 and accuracy of 0.971954.
- Experienced in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and improvement.
